<p><h1>Stent Assisted Coiling Market Size: Growth Outlook from 2024 to 2031, projecting at Market's Trends Analysis by Application, Regional Outlook, and Revenue</h1></p><p><strong>Stent Assisted Coiling Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Stent Assisted Coiling is a neurosurgical technique used for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. This procedure involves the use of a stent to maintain the shape of the blood vessel while coils are deployed to occlude the aneurysm, preventing it from rupturing. This technique is especially beneficial for wide-neck aneurysms that are difficult to treat with traditional coiling alone.</p><p>The Stent Assisted Coiling Market is projected to experience steady growth, with a CAGR of 3.60% during the forecast period. Factors contributing to this growth include the rising incidence of cerebrovascular diseases, increased awareness about minimally invasive procedures, and advancements in stent technology. The growing geriatric population, which is more susceptible to aneurysms, also plays a crucial role in market expansion.</p><p>Recent trends indicate a shift towards integrating advanced imaging technologies, enhancing procedural precision and patient outcomes. Additionally, there is an increasing focus on patient-centric approaches, with innovations aimed at improving safety profiles and reducing recovery times. The competitive landscape features collaboration between key players and the introduction of novel products that aim to meet the evolving needs of healthcare professionals and patients.</p></p>
