<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Face Exfoliator Exfoliating Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Physical Exfoliating Agent</li><li>Chemical Exfoliating Agent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The face exfoliator market comprises two main types: physical and chemical exfoliating agents. Physical exfoliators utilize granular substances, like scrubs or brushes, to mechanically slough off dead skin cells, providing immediate smoothness. In contrast, chemical exfoliators use active ingredients, such as alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs), to dissolve the bonds holding dead cells together, promoting cell turnover and enhancing skin texture over time. Both types cater to different skin types and preferences, offering varied benefits.</p></p>
