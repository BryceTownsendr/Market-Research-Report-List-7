<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tire Pressure Monitoring System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct TPMS</li><li>Indirect TPMS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) market includes two main types: Direct TPMS and Indirect TPMS. Direct TPMS uses sensors inside each tire to measure real-time pressure and transmit data to the vehicle's system, providing accurate readings. Indirect TPMS relies on wheel speed sensors and ABS data to estimate pressure by detecting changes in tire rotation, offering a cost-effective solution. Both systems enhance safety by alerting drivers to underinflated tires, but Direct TPMS is more precise, while Indirect TPMS is simpler and less expensive.</p></p>
