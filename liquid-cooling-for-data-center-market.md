<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Cooling for Data Center Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Phase Cooling</li><li>Two Phase Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Liquid cooling for data centers employs two primary market types: single-phase cooling and two-phase cooling. Single-phase cooling circulates a liquid, typically water, to absorb heat from servers, maintaining optimal temperatures. In contrast, two-phase cooling utilizes a liquid that transitions to vapor when heated, enhancing heat transfer efficiency and allowing for higher cooling capacities. Both methods offer advantages over traditional air cooling, promoting energy efficiency and improved thermal management, crucial for the increasing density of modern data center infrastructures.</p></p>
