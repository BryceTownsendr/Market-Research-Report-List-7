<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vortex Tube Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Uncooled (Adiabatic)</li><li>Cooled (Nonadiabatic)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vortex tube market can be divided into two primary types: uncooled (adiabatic) and cooled (nonadiabatic) vortex tubes. Uncooled vortex tubes operate by creating a temperature differential without external cooling, effectively using the energy from compressed air. In contrast, cooled vortex tubes utilize an external cooling mechanism to enhance temperature separation, providing more effective thermal management. Both types serve various industrial applications, including refrigeration, spot cooling, and pneumatic systems, offering unique benefits depending on the specific cooling requirements.</p></p>
