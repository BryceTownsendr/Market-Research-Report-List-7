<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Tyre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tyre</li><li>Bias Tyre</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vehicle tyre market primarily consists of radial and bias tyres. Radial tyres feature layers of fabric cords running perpendicular to the tread, offering better fuel efficiency, durability, and grip, making them popular for modern vehicles. Bias tyres have crisscrossed layers of fabric cords at an angle, providing stiffer sidewalls and higher load capacity, often used for heavy-duty or off-road applications. While radial tyres dominate the market due to performance advantages, bias tyres remain relevant in specific industrial and agricultural sectors.</p></p>
