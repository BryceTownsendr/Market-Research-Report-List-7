<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Boron Steel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid (0.001%-0.005%)</li><li>Brittle (above0.007%)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Boron Steel market can be categorized into two main types based on boron content. Rigid Boron Steel, containing 0.001%-0.005% boron, offers enhanced strength and ductility, making it ideal for automotive and structural applications. In contrast, Brittle Boron Steel, which has more than 0.007% boron, exhibits increased hardness but reduced toughness. This type is suitable for applications requiring high wear resistance, though its brittleness limits its usage in dynamic stress environments. Understanding these classifications helps in selecting the appropriate material for specific industrial needs.</p></p>
