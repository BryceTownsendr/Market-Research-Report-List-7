<p><p>The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system in commercial vehicles is an emission control technology designed to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. It works by recirculating a portion of the exhaust gases back into the engine's combustion chamber, lowering the combustion temperature and reducing the formation of harmful NOx. This system is critical for meeting stringent emission regulations, such as Euro 6 and Bharat Stage VI, and is widely adopted in diesel-powered commercial vehicles, including trucks and buses.</p><p>The Exhaust Gas Recirculation System in Commercial Vehicles Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.2% during the forecast period. This growth is driven by increasing environmental concerns, stricter emission norms, and the rising demand for fuel-efficient vehicles. Additionally, advancements in EGR technology, such as the integration of cooler systems and electronic controls, are enhancing its efficiency and adoption. Emerging markets in Asia-Pacific and Latin America are also contributing to the market expansion due to rapid industrialization and urbanization.</p><p>Key trends in the market include the development of hybrid EGR systems, which combine traditional EGR with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) for better emission control. Furthermore, the shift toward electric and hybrid commercial vehicles is influencing the market, as manufacturers focus on integrating EGR systems with alternative powertrains to meet future emission standards.</p></p>
