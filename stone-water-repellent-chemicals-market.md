<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stone Water Repellent Chemicals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Based</li><li>Solvent Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The stone water repellent chemicals market is categorized into two primary types: water-based and solvent-based products. Water-based repellents utilize a water-soluble formulation that penetrates stone surfaces while minimizing environmental impact. They are easier to clean up and are generally less toxic. In contrast, solvent-based repellents rely on organic solvents for formulation, offering deeper penetration and stronger protection against water damage, but may pose greater environmental and health risks. Both types serve to enhance the longevity and aesthetics of stone surfaces.</p></p>
