<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermostatic Radiator Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Operate TRVs</li><li>Electronics Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs) market is primarily divided into two types: self-operating TRVs and electronic valves. Self-operating TRVs regulate temperature using a mechanical sensor that adjusts the flow of hot water based on the surrounding room temperature. In contrast, electronic valves utilize digital controls and sensors to provide precise temperature regulation, often allowing for remote operation and programming. Both types contribute to energy efficiency and enhanced comfort in heating systems, catering to diverse consumer preferences and needs.</p></p>
