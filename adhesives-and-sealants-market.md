<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Adhesives and Sealants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-etching Adhesive</li><li>Selective-etching Adhesive</li><li>Total-etching Adhesive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The adhesives and sealants market features three primary types of dental adhesives: self-etching, selective-etching, and total-etching adhesives. Self-etching adhesives combine etching and bonding in one step, promoting efficient application without a separate etching phase. Selective-etching adhesives involve etching only the enamel while bonding to the dentin simultaneously. Total-etching adhesives require a distinct etching step for both enamel and dentin, providing excellent bond strength. Each type caters to different clinical needs and preferences, impacting their usage in dental applications.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Adhesives and Sealants Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Restoration Bonding</li><li>Indirect Restoration Bonding</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The adhesives and sealants market in the context of dental applications is segmented into direct and indirect restoration bonding. Direct restoration bonding involves applying materials directly to the cavity during dental procedures, ensuring immediate adhesion and a seamless finish. Indirect restoration bonding, on the other hand, uses prefabricated materials, such as crowns or bridges, that are created outside the mouth and later bonded in place. Both methods enhance dental durability, aesthetics, and patient comfort in restorative dentistry.</p></p>
