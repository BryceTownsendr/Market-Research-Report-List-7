<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aviation Obstruction Light Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Red Light (for building high as 45-90 meter)</li><li>White Light (for building taller than 150 meters)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Aviation Obstruction Light Market is categorized into two main types based on building height requirements. Red lights are typically used for structures ranging from 45 to 90 meters, providing visibility for aircraft during low visibility conditions. In contrast, white lights are designated for taller buildings over 150 meters, offering enhanced visibility for pilots flying at higher altitudes. Both types are essential for ensuring aviation safety, helping to prevent collisions with tall structures while integrating into nighttime and daytime environments.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Aviation Obstruction Light Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Less than 45 Meters from The Ground</li><li>45-105 Meters from The Ground</li><li>105-150 Meters from The Ground</li><li>More than 150 Meters from The Ground</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aviation obstruction light market is segmented by height categories to enhance aviation safety. For structures less than 45 meters, low-intensity lights provide visibility to low-flying aircraft. Between 45 and 105 meters, medium-intensity lights are used to mark taller obstacles. Heights from 105 to 150 meters require higher intensity to ensure visibility. For structures over 150 meters, high-intensity lighting systems with dual or multiple configurations are essential to alert pilots at significant distances, maintaining safety in increasingly congested airspace.</p></p>
