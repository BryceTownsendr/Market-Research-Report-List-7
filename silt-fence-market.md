<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Silt Fence Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Woven Fibres</li><li>Non-woven Fibres</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The silt fence market is primarily divided into two types based on the material used: woven and non-woven fibers. Woven silt fences are made from strong, interlaced fibers that provide high durability and resistance to tearing, making them suitable for environments with heavy sediment flow. Non-woven silt fences, on the other hand, feature a more porous structure that allows for better water permeability while effectively trapping sediments. Both types serve crucial roles in erosion control and sediment management in construction and landscaping projects.</p></p>
