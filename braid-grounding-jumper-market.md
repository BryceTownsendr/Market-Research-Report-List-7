<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Braid Grounding Jumper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-insulated</li><li>Insulated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Braid grounding jumpers come in two main market types: non-insulated and insulated. Non-insulated jumpers are typically used in applications where direct metal-to-metal contact is acceptable, providing effective grounding with low resistance. Insulated jumpers, on the other hand, offer protection against accidental electrical contact, making them suitable for more sensitive environments or applications involving higher voltages. Both types serve critical roles in ensuring safety and reliability in electrical systems, depending on the requirements of the specific installation.</p></p>
